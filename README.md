**What I am currently working on**

Currently I'm finalizing the very last project of the Inner Circle studies of Hive called corewar. You may have heard of the game core_war, which is what this project is based on. We are working in a group of 4 students tasked with making an assembler to translate instructions to bytecode that will be given to a Virtual Machine tasked with executing said bytecode. 

**Skills**


*C programming*

I have gone to the depths of C on multiple occasions during my studies in Hive. Most of the projects we have done are done in C. We have done things such as recreating the library command printf, made an algorithm to find paths for an ant colony and translate assembly code into bytecode and then read that bytecode with a virtual machine and do some simple actions.
I have a deep understanding of the C-language, and all the quirks it brings with it like memory allocation.


*Python*

I wanted to learn python so I decided to make a graphic visualizer for one of my projects I did at Hive called Filler. The Visualizer can be found on my project page for filler: https://github.com/ottkopo/42_filler
