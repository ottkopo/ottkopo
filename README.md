## What I am currently working on

Currently I'm finalizing the very last project of the Inner Circle studies of Hive called [corewar](https://github.com/HenronenGIT/corewar). You may have heard of the game core_war, which is what this project is based on. We are working in a group of 4 students tasked with making an assembler to translate instructions to bytecode that will be given to a Virtual Machine tasked with executing said bytecode.
