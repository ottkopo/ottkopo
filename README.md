## What I am currently working on

After finishing the final project of Hive, [corewar](https://github.com/HenronenGIT/corewar), I am now looking for an internship to finalize my studies at Hive and take my first steps in the IT field.


## Recent projects

[corewar](https://github.com/HenronenGIT/corewar) *(C, assembly, bytecode, memory manipulation)*
 - Recreate the engine that runs the game corewar, including an assembler to convert a champion file into bytecode and a virtual machine to run the whole game.
 
[lem_in](https://github.com/ottkopo/lem-in) *(C, pathfinding algorithms, optimization)*
 - Create a pathfinding algorithm to guide X ammount of ants from point A to point B in a map with Y ammount of rooms in the shortest ammount of turns possible.

[Filler](https://github.com/ottkopo/42_filler) *(C, Python, Heatmap, algorithms)*
 - Create an algorithm to play a game were 2 players take turns placing pieces on a map until one is unable to place any more pieces. I also created a neat visualizer for this project using Python.

## Animation I made to demonstrate the algorithm we used in the project lem-in
